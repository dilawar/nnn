-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nnn v1.0
2017-04-13

Modifications
- Behaviour and navigation
  - Detail view (default: disabled) with:
    - file type (directory, regular, symlink etc.)
    - modification time
    - human-readable file size
    - current item in reverse video
    - number of items in current directory
    - full name of currently selected file in 'bar'
  - Show details of the currently selected file (stat, file)
  - Disk usage analyzer mode (within the same fs, doesn't follow symlinks)
  - Directories first (even with sorting)
  - Sort numeric names in numeric order
  - Case-insensitive alphabetic content listing instead of upper case first
  - Key `-` to jump to last visited directory
  - Roll over at the first and last entries of a directory (with Up/Down keys)
  - Removed navigation restriction with relative paths (and let permissions handle it)
  - Sort entries by file size (largest to smallest)
  - Shortcut to invoke file name copier (set using environment variable `NNN_COPIER`)
- File association
  - Set `NNN_OPENER` to let a desktop opener handle it all. E.g.:
        export NNN_OPENER=xdg-open
        export NNN_OPENER=gnome-open
        export NNN_OPENER=gvfs-open
  - Selective file associations (ignored if `NNN_OPENER` is set):
    - Associate plain text files (determined using file) with vi
    - Associate common audio and video mimes with mpv
    - Associate PDF files with [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/)
    - Removed `less` as default file opener (there is no universal standalone opener utility)
    - You can customize further (see [how to change file associations](#change-file-associations))
  - `NNN_FALLBACK_OPENER` is the last line of defense:
    - If the executable in static file association is missing
    - If a file type was not handled in static file association
    - This may be the best option to set your desktop opener to
  - To enable the desktop file manager key, set `NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER`. E.g.:
        export NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER=thunar
- Optimization
  - All redundant buffer removal
  - All frequently used local chunks now static
  - Removed some redundant string allocation and manipulation
  - Simplified some roundabout procedures
  - Compiler warnings fixed
  - strip the final binary
